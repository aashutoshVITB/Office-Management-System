## Problem Statement
In many organizations, managing employee information, departmental records, and task assignments is handled manually, resulting in inefficiencies, data loss, and increased probability of errors. There is a need for an automated system to streamline these processes by organizing and managing office data efficiently, reducing manual intervention, and improving administrative effectiveness.

## Scope of the Project
This project focuses on providing a simple yet effective Office Management System that manages employee details, departments, and office tasks. It also offers tools for salary expense analysis by department and a lucky draw feature to randomly select employees for rewards. The system operates via a console interface and manages data in-memory without persistent storage, making it suitable for small to medium scale office environments.

## Target Users
- Small and medium business owners and HR managers who need to track employees and departmental assignments.
- Office administrators requiring simplified task delegation and employee management.
- Educational institutions or project teams as a learning tool for understanding office management concepts in software form.
- Any individual looking for a lightweight, easy-to-use Python-based office management solution.

## High-level Features
- Add and view employee details including name, age, department, and salary.
- Add and list departments to better organize the work structure.
- Manage tasks by assigning and listing them to employees.
- Calculate salary statistics (average, total, minimum, maximum) for each department.
- Conduct a lucky draw to randomly select an employee for incentives or recognition.
- Menu-driven console interface for user-friendly interaction.
